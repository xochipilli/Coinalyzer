Cryptocurrency pair price movement prediction based on neuronal networks (or other AI tech in the future).

This is my pet project written from scratch still in its infancy.

It is a web application run on Tomcat. A Maven project written in Java (1.7+) using Spring, JSF/PrimeFaces, Neuroph, TA4j, JFreeChart.

New commits done to the development branch, merged to master once in a while.
